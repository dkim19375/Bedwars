# Configuration
This section explains parts of the config that might not have been easy to
explain in the file itself (in the comments)

Most of the `config.yml` is already explained in the comments,
so for questions about the `config.yml` please join the discord server :)

**The information below will be about the `shop.yml`.**

Note: By default, it should have the default items in Hypixel,
if you notice something missing or changed, please let me know!

The structure of the `shop.yml` is like this:
```yaml
item-name: 
  details: values
another-item-name:
  details: values
```
For example, for wool:
```yaml
wool:
  slot: 19
  material: 'WOOL'
  amount: 16
  cost: 4
  cost-item: 'IRON'
  display-name: 'Wool'
  item-category: 'BLOCKS'
```
The name is `wool`, with the details being `slot`, `material`, etc.

There are a variety of options that you can configure your item with.

Below I explain every configuration option with this information:
- Key: The configuration key, for example above `slot` or `material` would both be keys.
- Required: `true`/`false`, True meaning that you will need this or else the item will not show. False means that it is optional.
- Description: Information about the option, such as what to put the value as.

**IMPORTANT: Examples are not complete - they are just meant to show you how to use the configuration option.**

## Slot
This is the location of the item. If it is a permanent item (such as a wooden sword), you may put this as `-1`.

This can be configured in two ways:
### Rows/Columns
Keys: `row` and `column`

Required: `true` (both)

`row` requires a number - the row, and `column` requires a number - the column.

Example:
```yaml
item:
  row: 3
  column: 2
```
In the GUI, it would be positioned like this:
```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  X  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
```
### Slot Number
Key: `slot`

Required: `true`

You can also use the slot number.

**The slot number starts at 0, unlike the Rows/Columns above**

It starts from the top left, then goes towards the right side.

Example:
```yaml
item:
  slot: 19
```
In the GUI, it would be positioned like this:
```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  X  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
```
## Material / Item Type
Key: `material`

Required: `true`

The `material` allows you to change the item type.

For example:
```yaml
item:
  material: 'WOOL'
```
would show a `Wool` block in the GUI.

For a list of all the materials, you may look on one of these website:

Latest version: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html#enum.constant.summary

Other version than latest: https://helpch.at/docs/VERSION/org/bukkit/Material.html#enum_constant_summary

Make sure to replace `VERSION` with the server version.

For example, https://helpch.at/docs/1.8.8/org/bukkit/Material.html#enum_constant_summary would
show the `material`s for `1.8.8`.
## Amount
Key: `amount`

Required: `true`

The `amount` changes the amount of items given when bought.

For example:
```yaml
item:
  amount: 5
```
would give 5 of the items specified.
## Potion Type
Key: `potion-type`

Required: `false` (Only required if the item is a potion)

This specifies what the potion effect will be.

For example:
```yaml
item: 
  potion-type: 'STRENGTH'

Latest version: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html#field.summary

Other version than latest: https://helpch.at/docs/VERSION/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html#field.summary

Make sure to replace `VERSION` with the server version.

For example, https://helpch.at/docs/1.8.8/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html#field.summary would
show the potion effect types for `1.8.8`.
## Potion Amplifiers
Key: `potion-amplifier`

Required: `false` (Only required if the item is a potion)

This specifies the potion amplifier.

For example:
```yaml
item:
  potion-amplifier: 2

would give a potion with the level 2. (Speed 2 for example)
## Potion Duration
Key: `potion-duration`

Required: `false` (Only required if the item is a potion)

This specifies how long the potion will last **in ticks**.

If you do not know what ticks are, then multiply the seconds * 20 to get the ticks.

For example:
```yaml
item:
  potion-duration: 600
```
would give a potion that lasts 30 seconds, since 30 seconds * 20 = 600 ticks.
## Enchants
Key: `enchants`

Required: `false`

This lets you apply different enchantments to the item.

For example:
```yaml
item:
  enchants:
    - 'DAMAGE_ALL'

For a list of all the enchantments, you may look on one of these website:

Other version than latest: https://helpch.at/docs/VERSION/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html#field.summary

Make sure to replace `VERSION` with the server version.

For example, https://helpch.at/docs/1.8.8/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html#field.summary would
show the enchants for `1.8.8`.
